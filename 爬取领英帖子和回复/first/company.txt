Her father had, in fact, told her not to take the exams because he wanted her to earn a salary to support the family, a common path for many young Singaporeans in those days.\n \nShe insisted, got her way, and won.

In fact, today, women play critical roles at DBS, forming 40% of the organisation\u2019s senior management.\n \nAnd their stories are of perseverance, opportunity and meritocracy; of \u201csteel magnolias\u201d who offered fortitude and grace to help a young bank bloom.\u201d\n \n__________________\n\nThis is an extract from the article \"In full bloom: Steel magnolias who forged DBS\u2019 mettle\".

The process of getting the application approved by the Bank of England then was a relatively circuitous one that required a lot of networking, said DBS veteran Lock Sai Hung, who was in charge of DBS international banking from 1977 to 1979.\n \n\u201cThe Bank of England was very conscious about the old boy network. Everything is funnelled through this network of connections.\u201d\n \nMr Lock made several visits to the Bank of England, a venerable institution with archaic traditions such as guards dressed in fine livery.\n \n\u201cYou would approach one of the guards and they will speak with a stiff upper lip, \u2018Who, Sir, may I have the pleasure of serving?\u2019\u201d he recounted.\n \n\u201cI gave my card, he would open the door a little and shout into the vast cavern, \u2018Mr Lock from the Development Bank of Singapore!\u2019. It echoed down that corridor and somebody else would take up the information and pass it on until it reached the Office of the Deputy Governor.\u201d\n \nAfter Mr Lock was admitted into the austere office, he found that there was no business discussion. \u201cThey\u2019re English. They\u2019re known for small talk,\u201d he said, with a wry smile.\n \nHe continued with the small talk and banter for a year before the bank finally received the green light to set up its office.\n \nWith London in the bag, New York was next.\n \n\u201cApproval was given at six months on the dot. It was a very good experience,\u201d said Mr Lock.\n \nSecuring prime office space for the DBS agency was equally smooth. In 1979, Mr Lock landed at the Newark Airport and was transported by helicopter to the World Trade Centre (WTC), which was owned by the Port Authority of New York.\n \nHe was welcomed by the chairman of the Port Authority, a close friend of former DBS chairman Howe Yoon Chong.\n \n\u201cHe said, \u2018Oh, Mr Lock, I've got everything set up for you. I have reserved space in the 80th story of WTC No.2 for your office.\u2019 And he gave us a 10% discount,\u201d recalled Mr Lock.\n \nOver the next few decades, DBS went on to expand overseas, which included opening its first Taiwan branch in Taipei in 1983, a rep office in Jakarta in 1989, a rep office in India in 1994 and a branch in the Dubai in 2006.\"\n \n__________________\n\nThis is an extract from the article \"The international start-up: Tales of DBS\u2019 overseas forays\u201d: https://go.dbs.com/3EBzR4i\n\nThis article is part of a series brought to you by DBS and produced by content agency The Nutgraf.
